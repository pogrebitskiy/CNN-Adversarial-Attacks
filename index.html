<h2>An Analysis of <i>Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial
  Attacks</i></h2>
<p></p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Computer Vision models have become very reliable classifiers of complex image data, however, they have been shown to be quite easily tricked into misclassifying slightly altered data.
  This paper tackles a critical challenge in the field of deep learning - the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks.
  Adversarial examples are inputs that are almost indistinguishable from natural data, yet are classified incorrectly by the network with high confidence.
  These attacks not only pose security implications, but also reveal that our current models are not necessarily generalizing as well as we would like.</p>

<p>We recreated the experiments by training five of our own models on the MNIST dataset and tested their adversarial robustness using PGD, BIM, and FGSM
  to generate adversarial examples. Our goal was to test a wider range of network architectures and determine how large of a role the structure 
  plays in the model's ability to generalize better, thus being more robust to adversarial attacks.
</p>
  
<p>Achieving adversarial robustness is an important step towards making networks more secure and reliable, 
especially in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving and malware detection. 
The insights from this work could pave the way for a new generation of deep neural networks that are much more resistant adversarial attacks.</p>

<h2>Paper Overview</h2>
<p>The key challenge addressed in this paper is the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples 
,inputs that are almost indistinguishable from natural data, yet are classified incorrectly.</p>

<p>
Through different experiments, the authors demonstrate that finding adversarial examples has a computationally efficient solution. 
With simple first-order methods like projected gradient descent (PGD) reliably finding local maxima with similar loss values. Leveraging these insights, 
the authors trained neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets that achieve high robustness against a wide range of adversarial attacks, 
including iterative methods like PGD. This represents a significant advance over prior work, which was often vulnerable to more sophisticated adversaries.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<h4>Model Training</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>2-layer fully connected:</strong>
    This network is a simple model with one hidden layer between the input and output layers.
    This model was used as a baseline for testing adversarial robustness against more complex architectures.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>VGG:</strong>
    VGG (Visual Geometry Group) is a deep convolutional neural network known for its simplicity and effectiveness. 
    It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, with progressively increasing depth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>LeNet:</strong>
    LeNet is one of the earliest convolutional neural networks, designed for handwritten digit recognition. 
    It comprises several layers of convolution, max-pooling, and fully connected layers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GoogLeNet:</strong>
    GoogLeNet, also known as Inception v1, is a deep convolutional neural network famous for its inception modules, 
    which allow for efficient training and better performance by using multiple parallel convolutional operations at each layer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ResNet:</strong>
    ResNet (Residual Network) introduced residual connections, enabling the training of very deep neural networks 
    by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. It features skip connections that add the input to the output of a deeper layer, 
    facilitating the flow of gradients during training.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We picked these models because each architecture contributed a substantial amount to the improvement of CNNs and computer vision.
  We wanted to see which architecture might be the most resistant to adversarial attacks.

</div>

<p>
  Each model was trained from scratch for 50 epochs on the MNIST dataset. We then tested each model's performance on
   the raw test set and adversarial adversarial images from each of the 3 types of attacks (PGD, BIM, FGSM).
</p>

<h4>Adversarial Training</h4>
<p>After evaluating the original and augmented test sets on the models, we further trained each model for an additional 10 epochs 
  using an augmented dataset. This new training data comprised a 50/50 split between original data and augmented images generated 
  using each of the three adversarial attacks (PGD, BIM, and FGSM), resulting in 5 distinct models trained on 3 datasets each, 
  totaling 15 models with their respective trained parameters.

<h2>Experimental Findings</h2>
<p>
  After incorporating adversarial examples into our training process, we observed a slight decrease in 
  the overall accuracy of our model on the original dataset. However, this reduction in accuracy was 
  accompanied by a significant increase in adversarial robustness. By exposing the model to adversarial 
  perturbations during training, it became more resilient to such attacks, demonstrating improved performance 
  when faced with previously unseen adversarial inputs. This trade-off between accuracy on 
  benign examples and robustness against adversarial attacks underscores the utility of incorporating 
  adversarial training techniques.

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
  GoogleNet and ResNet exhibited poor performance when tested with adversarial examples, despite their 
  good performance on the standard test data. This discrepancy might be attributed to the relatively small 
  size of the MNIST dataset, which could result in these larger models overfitting to the training data. 
  Consequently, the susceptibility of these models to even minor perturbations could be exacerbated 
  due to overfitting.

  </tbody></table>

  <p>Based on the table, here are some key insights:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>
      The first table shows that models without adversarial training (Original Data) achieve high accuracy 
      on clean examples but perform poorly on adversarial examples, highlighting the vulnerability of standard 
      models to adversarial attacks
    </li> 
    <li>ResNet appears to be the most robust model against adversarial attacks across all
       hardening methods (FGSM, BIM, PGD). It has the smallest accuracy drop on original 
       data compared to the hardened models, and the highest accuracy on adversarial examples.
    </li>
    <li>GoogLeNet also performs relatively well, especially on the FGSM adversarial examples where 
      it has the second highest accuracy of 0.9629. However, ResNet outperforms it on the BIM and 
      PGD adversarial sets.
    </li>
    <li>The 2-Layer Net model seems to be the least robust, having the
      largest accuracy drops when evaluated on adversarial examples compared to original data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Adversarial training with PGD hardening appears to provide the best robustness across models, 
      resulting in higher accuracies on PGD adversarial sets compared to FGSM and BIM for each model.
    </li>
    <li>VGG and LeNet have moderate robustness, performing better than the 2-Layer Net but worse than 
      GoogLeNet and ResNet on adversarial examples.
    </li>
    <li>For the more complex GoogLeNet and ResNet models, the accuracy drop on original data after 
      hardening is very small (0.0004), indicating that adversarial training did not significantly 
      impact their performance on clean data.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>In summary, the table suggests that more complex models like ResNet and GoogLeNet, coupled with strong adversarial training methods like PGD hardening, can provide significant robustness against adversarial attacks while maintaining high accuracy on original data.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
  The network architecture plays a crucial role in robustness to adversarial attacks. Deeper and more complex 
  models like ResNet and GoogLeNet exhibit higher robustness compared to simpler architectures like the 2-Layer 
  Net and LeNet, likely due to their increased capacity and flexibility to learn robust feature representations 
  during adversarial training. Architectural elements such as residual connections in ResNet and skip connections 
  in GoogLeNet's Inception modules contribute to maintaining performance on clean examples while learning 
  robustness against adversarial perturbations. In contrast, simple feed-forward architectures struggle to learn 
  robustness without compromising accuracy on clean data. While depth helps, architectural inductive biases
  beyond just stacking convolutions, as seen in the VGG results, may be necessary for robustness. The
  architectural design choices provide effective inductive biases that facilitate learning robust representations 
  against adversarial attacks during training.
</p>

<h4>Future Work</h4>
<p>Adversarial training techniques could be extended to broader applications and larger, more diverse datasets 
  beyond image classification tasks. As neural network architectures become more advanced, with innovations 
  like transformers and diffusion models, it will be crucial to investigate their robustness against sophisticated
  adversarial attacks tailored to these new architectures. A particularly concerning area is the potential to
  apply adversarial attacks to large language models (LLMs) with the goal of tricking them into generating 
  harmful or restricted content that they have been specifically trained not to produce. Developing robust LLMs
  resilient to such adversarial prompts will be critical for ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of
  these powerful AI systems across various domains.
