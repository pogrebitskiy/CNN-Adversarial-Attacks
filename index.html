<h2>An Analysis of <i>Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial
  Attacks</i></h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Computer Vision models have become very reliable classifiers of complex image data, however, they have been shown to be quite easily tricked into misclassifying slightly altered data.
  This paper tackles a critical challenge in the field of deep learning - the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks.
  Adversarial examples are inputs that are almost indistinguishable from natural data, yet are classified incorrectly by the network with high confidence.
  These attacks not only pose security implications, but also reveal that our current models are not necessarily generalizing as well as we would like.</p>

<p>We recreated the experiments by training five of our own models on the MNIST dataset and tested their adversarial robustness using PGD, BIM, and FGSM
  to generate adversarial examples. Our goal was to test a wider range of network architectures and determine how large of a role the structure 
  plays in the model's ability to generalize better, thus being more robust to adversarial attacks.
</p>
  
<p>Achieving adversarial robustness is an important step towards making networks more secure and reliable, 
especially in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving and malware detection. 
The insights from this work could pave the way for a new generation of deep neural networks that are much more resistant adversarial attacks.</p>

<h2>Paper Overview</h2>
<p>The key challenge addressed in this paper is the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples 
,inputs that are almost indistinguishable from natural data, yet are classified incorrectly.</p>

<p>
Through different experiments, the authors demonstrate that finding adversarial examples has a computationally efficient solution. 
With simple first-order methods like projected gradient descent (PGD) reliably finding local maxima with similar loss values. Leveraging these insights, 
the authors trained neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets that achieve high robustness against a wide range of adversarial attacks, 
including iterative methods like PGD. This represents a significant advance over prior work, which was often vulnerable to more sophisticated adversaries.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<h4>Model Training</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>2-layer fully connected:</strong>
    This network is a simple model with one hidden layer between the input and output layers.
    This model was used as a baseline for testing adversarial robustness against more complex architectures.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>VGG:</strong>
    VGG (Visual Geometry Group) is a deep convolutional neural network known for its simplicity and effectiveness. 
    It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, with progressively increasing depth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>LeNet:</strong>
    LeNet is one of the earliest convolutional neural networks, designed for handwritten digit recognition. 
    It comprises several layers of convolution, max-pooling, and fully connected layers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GoogLeNet:</strong>
    GoogLeNet, also known as Inception v1, is a deep convolutional neural network famous for its inception modules, 
    which allow for efficient training and better performance by using multiple parallel convolutional operations at each layer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ResNet:</strong>
    ResNet (Residual Network) introduced residual connections, enabling the training of very deep neural networks 
    by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. It features skip connections that add the input to the output of a deeper layer, 
    facilitating the flow of gradients during training.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We picked these models because each architecture contributed a substantial amount to the improvement of CNNs and computer vision.
  We wanted to see which architecture might be the most resistant to adversarial attacks.

<p>
  Each model was trained from scratch for 50 epochs on the MNIST dataset. We then tested each model's performance on
   the raw test set and adversarial adversarial images from each of the 3 types of attacks (PGD, BIM, FGSM).
</p>

<h4>Adversarial Training</h4>
<p>After evaluating the original and augmented test sets on the models, we further trained each model for an additional 10 epochs 
  using an augmented dataset. This new training data comprised a 50/50 split between original data and augmented images generated 
  using each of the three adversarial attacks (PGD, BIM, and FGSM), resulting in 5 distinct models trained on 3 datasets each, 
  totaling 15 models with their respective trained parameters.
